\title{Estimates marginal mean of recurrent events  based on two cox models}
\usage{
recurrent.marginal.coxmean(recurrent, death)
}
\arguments{
\item{recurrent}{aalen model for recurrent events}

\item{death}{cox.aalen (cox) model for death events}
}
\description{
Fitting two aalen models for death and recurent events these are
combined to prducte the estimator 
\deqn{ \int_0^t  S(u|x=0) dR(u|x=0) } the mean number of recurrent events, here
\deqn{ S(u|x=0) }  is the probability of survival, and 
\deqn{ dR(u|x=0) }  is the probability of an event among survivors. 
For now the estimator is based on the two-baselines so \deqn{x=0}, but covariates
can be rescaled to look at different x's and extensions possible.
}
\details{
IID versions along the lines of Ghosh & Lin (2000) variance. See also mets package for 
quick version of this for large data. 
IID versions used for Ghosh & Lin (2000) variance. See also mets package for 
quick version of this for large data mets:::recurrent.marginal, these two 
version should give the same when there are now ties.
